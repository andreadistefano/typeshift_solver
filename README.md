# How to use it

* clone the repo
* create a new text file inside the repo folder named `puzzle.txt` and write down the puzzle, writing the letters in lowercase for each column in each row (1st columnn of the puzzle in the 1st row of the file, 2nd column in the 2nd row etc...)
* `python main.py`
> Note: The dictionary is different from the one used in the game, so not all guesses will be accepted.
