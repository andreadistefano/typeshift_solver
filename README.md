Simple solver for [TypeShift](http://www.playtypeshift.com/), a game by [Zach Gage](https://www.stfj.net/).

No external dependencies. Tested on Python 3.9.

# How to use it
* clone the repo
*  write down the puzzle in `puzzle.txt`, writing the letters for each column in each row (1st columnn of the puzzle in the 1st row of the file, 2nd columns in the 2nd row etc...)
* `python main.py`

> Note: The dictionary contains more words than the one used in the game, so not all guesses will be accepted.
